# Webserver/GearScout
GearScout is a free scouting app for FRC teams with private and public datasets.
In order to contribute to the repository please contact me at: enan332@gmail.com
Yes this is my personal site, we are in between domains currently.

### Steps for setting up the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Enan456/webserver.git
cd webserver
npm install
```

### Pages to contribute to (and dependencies within)
 - sg.html- Add more css if you want, great intro to everything that is done
 - data.html- main priority, getting data from the form and database and displaying it
 - gs.html- unstable branch for reactJS

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)

### Tech

GearScout uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - duh
* Firebase by google

### Todos

 - implement gulp
 - Get data analysis to work
 - fix firebase connection (once complete check every friday and monday just in case)
