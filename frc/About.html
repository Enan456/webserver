The team was created by a group of dedicated students and one willing sponsor (Caterpillar) who wanted to form a FIRST FRC team in Oswego Community Unit School District 308.

During our first season in 2008 at the Midwest Regional our team won the Rookie All Star award. This allowed us to compete at the World Championships in Atlanta, GA. We placed 14th in our division.
<br><br>
In 2009, we attended the Wisconsin Regional and Midwest Regional. We won the Safety Award at the Midwest Regional and made it to finals.
<br><br>
In 2010 we again attended the Wisconsin Regional and Midwest Regional. We won our first Spirit Award at the Midwest Regional.
<br><br>
In 2011, we won the Spirit Award at the Midwest Regional for the second year in a row. We also attended Championships.
<br><br>
In 2012, we attended the Midwest Regional and the inaugural year of the Queen City Regional. We won the Judges' Award at Midwest.
<br><br>
In 2013, we attended the Wisconsin Regional, Midwest Regional, and Championships. We were part of the winning alliance at the Wisconsin Regional which gave us the opportunity to attend Championships. We won the Gracious Professionalism Award, Midwest Regional Poster Design, and FIRST Dean's List Finalist Award at Midwest. We placed 9th in the Galileo Division at Championships. We have grown our sponsorship program to 27 sponsors, with Caterpillar and Oswego Community Unit School District 308 as our top supporters. We are excited our team was invited to IRI.
<br><br>
In 2014, we attended the Crossroads Regional and the Midwest Regional. We were part of the finalist alliance at the Midwest Regional. Our team was invited to the Michigan Advanced Robotics Competition and R2OC.
<br><br>
In 2015, we attended the Wisconsin Regional and the Midwest Regional. We won the Judges' Award in the Wisconsin Regional. In the Midwest Regional, we finished qualifications in first place of 53 teams and were the alliance captain of the finalist alliance. In both regionals, we received the highest OPR (Offensive Power Rating). In addition, we won the most prestegious award in FIRST, the Regional Chairman's Award. This qualified the team to attend Championships. In St. Louis, we powered through the Archimedes Division coming out as the Championship Subdivision Winner. This qualified our team, along with teams 1023 (Bedford Express), 3996 (RIKITIK), and 1089 (Team Mercury), to participate in Einstein Field. This was our first time at Einstein Field, and we finished strong at fourth place during the semifinals. Arguably our best robotics season to date, we were also invited to IRI again. In Indianapolis, we finished in 3rd place during the off-season event, despite our position as the 8th seed alliance captain. We were also invited to R2OC, where we ended strong in the semifinals.
<br><br>
In 2016, we attended the Arkansas Rock City Regional and the Midwest Regional. We won the Team Spirit Award in the Arkansas Rock City Regional. In the Midwest Regional, we finished qualifications in third place of 52 teams and were part of the finalist alliance. Plus, we won the most prestigious award in FIRST for a second year in a row in the Midwest Regional, the Regional Chairman's Award. This qualified our team to attend Championships in St. Louis. In St. Louis, we ended up being semifinalists in the Archimedes Division and also won the Gracious Professionalism Award in the Tesla-Archimedes subdivision. Once again, we were invited to IRI and R2OC. In Rockford, we powered through the elimination matches and won the competition.
<br><br>
In 2017, we attended the Central Illinois Regional and the Midwest Regional. We won the Judges' Award in the Central Illinois Regional. For the third consecutive year in the Midwest Regional, we won the most prestigious award in FIRST: the Regional Chairman's Award. This allowed us to qualify for the Championships in St. Louis. We will be attending the off-season event R2OC in July.
<br><br>
In 2018, we will be attending the Central Illinois Regional and the Midwest Regional.</p>
