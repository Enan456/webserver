Hi,
If you are reading this you have the unfortunate event of having to update the website. Let me
give you some knowledge. This was written on feb. 1, 2019. yes the year is important because the
last redesign was in 2011. This site has used joomla and drupal. The next logical step would be to 
use word press right? Please don't, stick to html, easiest to pass down. I should probably tell you 
who I am, I am Enan Srivastava, and am graduating this year so I am writing this as documentation.

So the current site has the following files:
all of the favicon files
assets/
css/
images/
js/
lib/
teampictures/
About.html
backup.doc
browserconfig.xml
calender.html
elements.html
ftcandfll.html
images.html
index.html
landing.html
Media.html
News.html
OtherTeams.html
Sponsors.html
test.html

I didn't dare mess with the rest of the site because time. 
Please shoot me an email with any questions: enan332@gmail.com
good luck! also please update this file so in another 7 years people know what happened here
